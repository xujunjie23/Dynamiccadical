# DynamicCaDiCaL

DynamicCaDiCaL is a SAT solver based on the CaDiCaL solver, which implements dynamic parameter tuning and advanced techniques for SAT solving. It is designed to test different configurations and performance of the solver in various benchmarks.

## Features

- Based on the CaDiCaL SAT solver
- Dynamic parameter tuning and multi-armed bandit algorithms
- Supports benchmark instance input and outputs results for SAT and UNSAT cases
- Generates DRAT proofs for UNSAT instances
